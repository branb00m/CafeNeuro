## A theme specifically made for people who have ADHD/Autism!

(***I made this theme to target people (like myself) who have ADHD/Autism and make the colors appealing towards people who have either!)***
(**This is a friendly theme that is _NOT_ discriminating the disorder, but only for programmers like myself who have autism!**)

This theme has unique, well-thought out colors that make your text editor appear with vibrancy, whilst also contrasting to darkness.

This theme for the people who are "Night Owls" too!

This theme also makes it easier for you to write code in the late night of your subterranean lair whilst bopping out to tunes.

I hope you like the theme. If you're not so sure about downloading this theme, check out some people who have seen the theme, write code on a near daily basis and have tried it out:
